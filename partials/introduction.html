	<h2>How fast is your Internet, really?</h2>
	<p>cSpeed will benchmark your browsing experience by launching popular Web sites and measuring their</p>
	<p>load time. Clicking the button below will launch, one after the other, 20 Web sites in new tabs. After</p>
	<p>launching the test, we recommend waiting for it to finish before you resume browsing. <a class="link" href="">Learn more.</a></p>

		About cSpeed
	</div>

	<div id="aboutus">
	cSpeed tests the quality of your browsing experience by directly measuring how much time it takes to load a list of popular Web pages. <b>cSpeed does not collect any personal Web-browsing information.</b> We do record your IP address, ISP, city, and browser user-agent (which includes your operating system and browser version). We also run a small computational test to measure javascript performance.<br><br>
				
	cSpeed was developed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/xuefeng-zhu/58/20a/a21">Xuefeng Zhu</a>, <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~singla2/">Ankit Singla</a>, and <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~pbg/">P. Brighten Godfrey</a>, computer scientists at <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>. This work is part of a larger <a href="http://cspeed.net">speed-of-light Internet project</a> with our collaborators <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/~balac/">Bala Chandrasekaran</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/~bmm/">Bruce Maggs</a> at Duke University. The first step, of course, is to measure how fast the Internet is today. We developed cSpeed with twin objectives: (a) to measure Internet speed across a diverse set of users; and (b) to provide you a way of comparing Internet service options in your area. Unlike other 'speed tests', cSpeed directly evaluates your browsing experience by loading Web sites, instead of measuring bandwidth. <a href="faq.html" target="_blank">Learn even more.</a>
